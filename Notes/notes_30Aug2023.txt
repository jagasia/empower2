---------------------------------
Activity
	identify the functions used in SQL
--------------------------------
1) WHERE clause
	condition should be boolean expression that results in true or false
	for multiple conditions, you can use 	Logical operators like AND OR

	WHERE salary>9000 AND salary<15000
2) ORDER BY clause
	to sort the result in particular order(s)

select * from hr.employees
order by salary;

select * from hr.employees
order by salary desc;

select * from hr.employees
order by job_id, salary;

select * from hr.employees
order by job_id desc, salary asc;

ORDER BY clause should be the last part of a SELECT query.

------------------------
GROUP BY
	what is the need for group by?

whenever we use aggregate functions, we get 1 result per table.
	SUM
	COUNT
	MIN
	MAX
	AVG
SELECT SUM(SALARY) FROM HR.EMPLOYEES;

Result:
691416



SELECT JOB_ID, SUM(SALARY) FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
    GROUP BY JOB_ID;

Result:
JOB_ID	SUM(SALARY)
AD_VP	34000
FI_ACCOUNT	39600
PU_CLERK	13900
SH_CLERK	64300
HR_REP	6500
PU_MAN	11000
AC_MGR	12008
ST_CLERK	55700
AD_ASST	4400
IT_PROG	28800
SA_MAN	61000
AC_ACCOUNT	8300
FI_MGR	12008
ST_MAN	36400
AD_PRES	24000
MK_MAN	13000
SA_REP	250500
MK_REP	6000
PR_REP	10000

So we understand that GROUP BY produces 1 result per GROUP.



SELECT JOB_ID, SUM(SALARY) FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
    GROUP BY JOB_ID
	ORDER BY SUM(SALARY)



SELECT JOB_ID, SUM(SALARY) FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
    WHERE SUM(SALARY)>20000
    GROUP BY JOB_ID
	ORDER BY SUM(SALARY)
	
ERROR:
ORA-00934: group function is not allowed here



SELECT JOB_ID, SUM(SALARY) FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
    -- WHERE SUM(SALARY)>20000
    GROUP BY JOB_ID
    HAVING SUM(SALARY)>20000
	ORDER BY SUM(SALARY)
	

What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
	WHERE is used to restrict the rows
	HAVING is used to restrict the groups

-------------------
Activity:
	Identify the correct use of
	WHERE
	ORDER BY
	GROUP BY
	HAVING

1) Display alls the employee's id, first name, last name, salary where salary is between 10k and 15k
2) Display those results in the order of salary
3) Display the number of employees present in the organisation whose department number is 90
4) Display the number of employees in each department
5) Display the average salary of employees in each department
6) Display the minimum, maximum salaries of each department employees.
