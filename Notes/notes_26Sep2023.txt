Day 21: (26-Sep-2023)
------------------------------
C programming:
	control statements, arrays, strings
-------------------------------------------------------------
if
if-else
if-else if-else
switch case
while
do-while
for-loop
----------------------------
arrays
	sizing the arrays are done while declaring itself

	int arr[10];		we have declared an array and sized it there itself
	in old version, the size must be constant.

	but in new versions, we are allowed to provide variable as size


Demo:
Profit Share
Ramu, Gopu and Samu are three friends who own a fruit shop. All three have invested certain amount for starting the shop. They share the profit proportionate to the ratio of the shares they have invested. Given the Profit amount and the ratio of shares of Ramu,Gopu and Samu ,write a program to find the amount of profit that will go to Ramu, Gopu and Samu.

Input Format:
First line is an integer that denotes the Profit Amount.
Second line consists of 3 Space separated integers that denote the ratio values of Ramu,Gopu,Samu respectively

Output Format:
A double value that denotes the Ramu's profit amount.
A double value that denotes the  Gopu's profit amount.
A double value that denotes the  Samu's profit amount.
[Note : The output values are rounded off to 2 decimal places]

Sample Input 1:
10000

Sample Output 1:
2000.00
4000.00
4000.00

Sample Input 2:

House for Sale
Ramu has bought a house for X rupees, and he has planned to sell it after n years. He knows the rate at which the house value changes each year, for n years. He is very eager to know the value of his house after n years. 
Write a    progam to help Ramu know the value of his house after n years.

Note: The value of the house can increase as well as decrease.

Input Format:
First line of the input is an integer that corresponds the value X.
Second line of the input is the number of years, n.
Third line consists of n space separated integers that correspond to the rates at which the house value changes every year.

Output Format:
Output is a double value that coresponds to the value of Ramu's House after n years.(rounded off to 2 decimal places).

Sample Input 1:
150000
3
10 12 -10
Sample Output 1:
166320.00 

Explanation:
Cost of house 150000
Value of house increaes 10 % in first year = 150000.00 + 15000.00 = 165000.00
Value of house increaes 12 % in second year = 165000.00 +19800.00 = 184800.00
Value of house decreases 10 % in third year = 184800.00 - 18480.00 = 166320.00

After the third year the house value is 166320.00 . 

Sample Input 2:
10000

1 2 3
Sample Output 1:
10611.06

Challenge:
Number Addition
 Gopu is a third grade kid, and new to numbers and the operations performed on it. Parallel to that he learns computer programming. So instead of storing a number in an integer variable, A, he created an array and stored the digits in that array. Now, if a second number, X, is given (as a single integer), he needs to calculate the sum.
Write a program to help Gopu in finding the sum and print the resultant value.

Input format:
First line of the input is an integer that denotes the number of digits, n, in the first number, A.
Second line of the input consists of space separated integers(single digit each), which corresponds to the n digits of the first number, A.
Third line of the input is an integer that denotes the  second number, X.

Note: The maximum value of 'n', i.e., the number of digits in A is 100.

Output format:
Space separated digits of the resultant number.

Sample Input 1:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output 1:
1 2 3 4 6


Sample Input 2:
