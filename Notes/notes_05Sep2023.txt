Day 7:
Using IDE for java.	Integrated Development Environment
Most common IDE used for java is Eclipse
	other ides like netbeans, visual studio code, intelliJ 

Spring Tool Suite	is the IDE, i am using. Because, it will be useful for spring boot projects.

Spring ToolSuite	STS
STS is also an Eclipse (plus spring plugins)

Eclipse for Java developers (is only for core java)
Eclipse for Java EE developers

Support required:	install Java version 8 or later

Eclipse is allowed to download and unzip. No issues.

I will show you using eclipse.
while opening eclipse, it asks me to choose the directory as workspace.
We choose a folder in our system where all the projects i create in eclipse shall be stored.

the project name shall be all lowercase and multiple words are separated by -

ex:	05-sep-01

OOPS concepts
	Inheritance
	Encapsulation
	Polymorphism
	Abstraction

these are the 4 pillers of OOPS

Inheritance:
	code reusability
	child class can inherit from parent
	we dont need to create a class from scratch
	we can derive a new class from existing class
	the child class behave like parent or it can override it
	is based on a concept called "Open - Close" principle
	Open to Extension. Close to Modification.	GoF

class ContractEmployee extends Employee

Types of inheritance:
	Single inheritance
	Multiple inheritance
	Multi-level inheritance
	Hybrid inheritance

Single inheritance
	only 1 super class
	how many sub class?		any number of sub class.

Multiple inheritance
	multiple super classes
	how many sub class?		any number of sub class.

Multi-Level inheritance
	Sub class is super class for another sub class
	how many sub class?		any number of sub class.

Hybrid 
	combination of any two types

Java does not support multiple inheritance.

class C extends A,B	//is not possible in java

Adharsh challenges us. He says Java supports multiple inheritance using Interface.
---------------------------------
Furniture
Chair
BookShelf

Furniture is not concrete. It is abstract. It can be a super class only.

1) Chair
2) BookShelf
3) Exit


What is a property of a class?
	any variable of a class that has getter/setter/both is a property.
	if only getter is there, then it is read-only property
	if only setter is there, then it is write-only property
	if both are there, then it is read-write property
	if both are not there, then it is not a property


Pending:
	Access specifiers

Order or constructors
	super class constructor
	sub class constructor


Activity:
	understand what are destructors in java.
	What is overriding
		constructor overriding
		method overriding
Overriding is the process of re-defining the super class method
-----------------------------------------
Shape
	String name
	String bgColor
	String borderColor
Circle
	calculateArea	method
		//3.14*r*r	just print a message like this
Triangle
	calculateArea
		//0.5*b*h
Rectangle
	calculateArea
		//l*b
