Day 23: (28-Sep-2023)
------------------------------
To call RESTful webservice,
1) java program
2) mvc project using feign client
3) Rest Template
----------------------------------------------
You will have multiple web service projects running simultaneously. How one service running in a separate port can call another service running in a different port?
Otherwise, you will tend to create a single project that contains, all entities, repositories, services, controllers all in one project for your convenience. But that does not form a microservices architecture.

If you try to make payment in an app like swiggy/ bookmyshow and find that credit card payment fails. You may try Gpay or netbanking or lazy pay.
These are independent services. One is down, doesn't affect another.

Entity classes, can be copied to all the services. (remove the annotations in all other projects)
They serve as a type. 


1) Java project:
	how to call a restful webservice (no matter, in which technology it is created) from a java project.
	first lets run a web service.

We have created a simple restful webservice running the 5001 port. We are able to access it using the below url:
	http://localhost:5001/

Lets see how to access this webservice from a java project.
----------
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//to access the webservice at http://localhost:5001/
		try {

            URL url = new URL("http://localhost:5001/employee");//your url i.e fetch data from .
            HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
            conn.setRequestProperty("Accept", "application/json");
            if (conn.getResponseCode() != 200) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Failed : HTTP Error code : "
                        + conn.getResponseCode());
            }
            InputStreamReader in = new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream());
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(in);
            String output;
            while ((output = br.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(output);
            }
            conn.disconnect();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Exception in NetClientGet:- " + e);
        }
		System.out.println("Hello world");
	}

}

---------------------------
Activity:
Create a simple restful webservice that contains url for
get	a simple message
get	a json

create a java project and access that webservice using the url
mention the correct MIME type to access and print the message retrieved from webservice.
