Day 25: (03-Oct-2023)
------------------------------
What is Pro C?
	is a part of Oracle software.
	precomp folder in oracle home directory is used for Pro C.
Precomp means pre compiler

Pro C is a language which must be translated into C language code.
C language again will be compiled to get object code that can be execute.

Why Pro C is required?
	it is required, when you want to execute SQL statement from C language.

To compile proc program to c program, we use
	proc

one.proc	to one.c
the above command produces file with extension c

To compile c program to object code, we use
	gcc

one.c	to	a.exe

--------------------------

Activity:
Identify the directory structure of Pro C in oracle.

Python Topics:
--------------------
Fundamentals
Operators
Control Flow
Loops
Functions
Lists
Strings

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0


x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))


x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'


Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.


Camel Case
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "John"
Pascal Case
Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "John"
Snake Case
Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "John"


Many Values to Multiple Variables
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


One Value to Multiple Variables
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

Example
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


Unpack a Collection
If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

Example
Unpack a list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)




x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
i="!"
print(x, y, z+i)
the output is:
	Python is awesome!



x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)
the above gives ERROR!


x = 5
y = "John"
print(str(x) + y)
output:	5John


x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
output:	5 John

Python - Global Variables
--------------------------------------
A variable declared outside a function is global by default.
They are available inside and outside any function.
A variable declared inside a function, is not available outside the function. But
if you declare it as global, then it is available outside the function also.

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

Activity:
complete the variables in python and identify the data types in python.
-----------------------------------------

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators


Activity:
	Understand the operators used in python
