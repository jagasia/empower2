Day 15:
Java Servlets
-----------------
Java code can be 
	Scriplet
	Servlet
	MIDlet
	
Server side programming in java is called as Servlet
JSP and Servlet
	both are web components created using Java Enterprise Edition

What is a servlet?
	it is a class derived from HttpServlet
	HttpServlet is derived from GenericServlet

	if you write java program and embed html code inside it, it is Servlet
	if you write html code and embed java code inside it, it is JSP

html code is static
	so in order to respond to user actions, we need dynamic aspect, ie., scripting.

scripting is 2 types:
	client side
	server side

client side:
	javascript, vbscript etc are scripts that are executed at client's browser.

server side:
	ASP, JSP, PHP, Servlet
	are server side scripts that runs in server and the output is sent to browser.

	For accessing server side resources like database, we need server side scripting.

Hello world program in servlet:
1) File -> New -> Project
	Dynamic Web Project			Eclipse for Java Enterprise / EE developers

	Target runtime:	<none>
		we can add target runtime
		choose Apache Tomcat 9.0.37	folder that contains bin/lib
	
2) create a servlet
	right click projecgt -> New -> Servlet
	package name:		view
	class name:		MyServlet

3) Run as "Run on server"		
4) Error:		Port 8080 required by Tomcat v9.0 Server at localhost is already in use. The server may already be running in another process, or a system process may be using the port. To start this server you will need to stop the other process or change the port number(s).

we can change the port in which our server should run.
	in "servers" tab,	(window -> Show view -> servers)
	double click the server.
		change the port number

Run

change the default browser.
-----------------------
Servlet can get input using "request" object
Servlet can give output using "response" object


	protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.print("Hello this is empower best batch");
	}
