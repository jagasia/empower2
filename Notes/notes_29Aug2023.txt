---------------------------------
Pending:
	constraints	at column level, table level
	adding constraints to the columns while 
	creating table, 
	alter table, 

	drop constraints

constraints
	restrictions
	conditions that must pass
	limit
	boundary
	rules that must comply
These constraints are used to enfore data integrity.

are applied to columns of a table

PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY
CANDIDATE KEY
ALTERNATE KEY
SUPER KEY
COMPOSITE KEY
UNIQUE CONSTRAINT
NOT NULL CONSTRAINT
CHECK CONSTRAINT

These constraints are used to enfore data integrity.
what is data integrity?
	correctness of the data
types of integrity:
	Entity integrity
	Domain integrity
	Referential integrity
	User defined data integrity

What is Entity integrity?	(Primary key)		row level
	ensures that we would be able to identify any record (row) in a table uniquely using one or more column(s).	These columns are primary key column(s).

What is Domain integrity?	column level
	Data in a column must follow the domain rule.
	we can implement domain integrity using 
		CHECK constraint
		
What is Referential integrity?
	The data in a table will be verified against the data in another table.
	The foreign key of a table is verified against the primary key of another table.	

1 Steven 	King	1231	(1231 is an invalid department id. So it is not allowed here)
	
	
Foreign key
	allows NULL
	allows Duplicate
	can be created that references a column which is UNIQUE and NOT NULL
	can be composite, when the primary key it references is composite.

	supports the following response to DELETE and UPDATE of primary key table records
		CASCADE
		RESTRICT		(by default)
		SET NULL		(NULLIFY)	

Primary key is in MASTER table
Foreign key is in DETAILS table 		(also called as TRANSACTION table)

USER_MASTER		(has no foreign keys)
SALES_DETAILS		(has foreign keys)

What is User Defined Data integrity?
	Any rules enforced other than the above integrity, are user defined.
	we can implement them using Triggers, User defined types

Practical:

1) PRIMARY KEY
	does not allow NULL
	does not allow DUPLICATES
	can be COMPOSITE
	can be defined even after the table is created already.

CREATE TABLE TICKETS
(
  id int,
	seatno VARCHAR2(100),
    theatreName VARCHAR2(100)
);
	
INSERT INTO TICKETS VALUES(1, 'A1','PVR Soul Spirit Mall');
INSERT INTO TICKETS VALUES(1, 'A1','PVR Soul Spirit Mall');

ALTER TABLE TICKETS ADD CONSTRAINT PKTICKETS1 PRIMARY KEY (ID);
--Error
ORA-02437: cannot validate (SQL_NUEVXSBXIDXBAASYYMEIWVBCG.PKTICKETS1) - primary key violated 


DELETE FROM TICKETS;

2 row(s) deleted.

INSERT INTO TICKETS VALUES(1, 'A1','PVR Soul Spirit Mall');
1 row(s) inserted.

INSERT INTO TICKETS VALUES(2, 'E11','INOX Nexus Forum Mall');
1 row(s) inserted.


select * from tickets;

2 rows selected.



ALTER TABLE TICKETS ADD CONSTRAINT PKTICKETS1 PRIMARY KEY (ID);
Table altered.

Activity:
1) Create a table and define primary key for a column at column level
2) Create a table and define primary key for a column at table level
3) Create a table without primary key and ALTER the table and add constraint with constraint name
4) Remove that constraint 	(problem: we dont know the constraint name.  Find the constraint name from dictionary. 	SELECT * FROM USER_CONSTRAINTS;
