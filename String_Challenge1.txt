Character at Index

Somu has an excellent visualization skill using which he answers any logical and arithmetic calculation by mind calculation. To test his skill, Ramu gave him the following question. Given a String, s, and an integer, i, find the character present at the given index, i, when the string is repeatedly concatenated.
Write a program to  help Somu.

Input Format:
First line of the input is the string, s. Assume max length of the string is 50.
Second line is an Integer that denotes the index value, i.

Output Format:
Output is a character present at ith index.

Note:
Print "Invalid" if the index is negative.

Sample Input 1:
Amphibian
25
Sample Output 1:
a

Sample Input 2:
Java
-1
Sample Output 2:
Invalid 


Explanation for Sample1:
input String is "Amphibian".
After repeated concatenation, the string becomes "AmphibianAmphibianAmphibianAmphibian......"
The character at 25 th index is 'a'.

Last Character

Rahul was tired after studying for so long , so he thought to play a small game with the words from his book . He opens a random page and selects a random word from it , and also  chooses the last digit of that page number n . Given an array of characters,Write a program to help Rahul find the last character that occurs n(last digit of the page number) times in the array . If no such character exists,then print -1.

Input Format:
First input is an integer that denotes the size of the array.
Second line consists of  series of characters  seperated by a space that denotes the array values.
Third input is an integer that denotes the n value.

Output Format:
Output is a character that denotes the last character which occurs n times.

Sample Input 1:
8
a a b c n s d n
2

Sample Output 1:
n

Explanation:
    In the given array 'a' and 'n' occurs 2 times which is equal to the n value . Even though 'a' occurs twice ,'n' is the one that occurs last.    
    
Sample Input 2:
5
a b c d e
3

Sample Output 2:
-1

Masked Numbers

Vignesh was a mischievous boy and due to his rude behaviour at class , his teacher gave him an assignment as punishment and told him to complete it within one day . His assignment was to find the masked numbers . A masked number is a string that consists of digits and one X that should be replaced by exactly one digit.Given a string  N as input  ,Write a program to help Vignesh find all the possible solutions to replace the X with a digit so as to get a value that is divisible by Y.If no number is found then print "-1". 

Input format: 
First input is a string that denotes the string value N (only 3 digits and X will always be in the center). 
Second input is an integer that denotes the Y value. 

Output format: 
Output is a series of integers that satisfies the condition seperated by a comma. 
The integers are displayed sorted in ascending order. 
If the condition is not satisfied, print "-1" 

Sample Input 1: 
1X0 
6 
Sample Output 1: 
120,150,180 

Sample Input 2: 
5X3 
23 
Sample Output 2: 
-1

Tic-Tac Toe Game

Meyyappan and Roshan are playing tic tac toe game. A tic tac toe game is won only if any of X or O is consecutively marked in a straight line, either row-wise or column-wise or diagonally. Given a 2D matrix with only X and O, where X represents Meyyappan's game and O represents Roshan's game, determine who won the game. If no one has won it, then print "Draw".

Input Format:
Input consists of a 3x3 character matrix (only X and O).

Output Format:
Output is a string that denotes the winner of the game , Meyyappan/Roshan/Draw.

Sample Input 1:
X O O
X O X
O X X

Sample Output 1:
Roshan

Sample Input 2:
X X O
O O X
X O X

Sample Output 2:
Draw
