Day 1:
Database Fundamentals - 
Oracle SQL & PL/SQL	Basics, Normalization, SQL(DDL, DML, TCL, DRL, DCL) Commands, Joins
---------------------------------------
Your idea about database:
	to store data in the form of tables
	to manage the data
	to insert/update/delete/merge the data (manipulation)
	to retrieve the data
	to organize the data
	to derive data from the data		(dob to age)
	to prevent redundancies
	to access data from anywhere
	to provide concurrent access

Advantage of database over unstructured data.


data is processed to produce information
Input - Process -Output		(cycle)

1970s	Relational Database concept was invented by Dr. E.F. Codd
row-column format is called as Relation
table is an example for relation
Relations can have relationship

Dr. Codd defines 12 rules for a Relational Database Management System	(RDBMS)

There were several types of databases:
	Logical
	Row based
	E-R		Entity-Relationship
	Hierarchical 	parent-child	(like a tree)
	Object based
	Relational


E-R 
	whenever you design a project, you start identifying the following:
	1) write down the business process in English.
	2) Underline the nouns
	3) Choose the nouns that participate directly in the business

Ex
	customer purchase product

nouns:
	customer
	product

these nouns become ENTITY

these entities become TABLE(s)

the relationship between the entities can be:
	ONE TO ONE
	ONE TO MANY
	MANY TO ONE
	MANY TO MANY

ONE TO ONE
	One Department has One Manager
	in that case, merge them.	
		In department table, add a column called departmentHead

ONE TO MANY
	One Department has Many Employees


DEPARTMENTS
	DID	DNAME	LOCATION	DHEAD	

EMPLOYEES
	EID	ENAME	DID
	101	STEVEN	1
	102	NEENA	1
	103	JAG	1
	104	SUBA	2


MANY TO ONE
	Many Employees belong to One Department
	
MANY TO MANY
	the relationship becomes an entity
	CUSTOMER vs PRODUCT	is many to many
	but the relationship becomes an entity 	SALES

	CUSTOMER
	SALES
	PRODUCT

	So, CUSTOMER to SALES		is One to Many
	PRODUCT to SALES			is One to Many


-------------------
Relational Theory terminology:
Data
Database
Record	/	Row	/	Tuple
Column
NULL
Relation	/	Table	/	Entity
Relationship
UNION
UNION ALL
INTERSECT
JOIN
DIVIDE
MINUS


Data	is the unit of information
Database	is a logical unit of collection of tables and other database objects
	is made up of file(s)
Table	is a logical unit

Record	is a row in the table

NULL	is missing information. It is not a space. It is not 0. It is not (null).
UNION	is combination of the relations.
		10+10	is maximum 20
UNION ALL	10+10	is always 20

INTERSECT	the common records between 2 relations.
MINUS		First relation MINUS the common between Second relation
DIVIDE		To find all the entities which have relationship with all the entities in 		another relation

JOIN		= PRODUCT (Multiplication)
		When we need to retrieve records from more than 1 table, we use JOINs
---------------------
Activity:
	Identify the different types of database models
	What is normalization?
	Create an account in livesql
		https://livesql.oracle.com


What is normalization?
	you all identified:
		aims to reduce redundancy
		is a scientific approach for designing a database
		steps are defined as normal forms


Redundancy means?
	Repeated data
	unnecessary repeatation of same data in multiple locations (columns/ tables)
	example for redundancy:
		Attendance table
			dateOfAttendance	EmployeeId	EmployeeName
	here, employeeName is dependent on EmployeeId

	risk here is 
	
	28-Aug-23		1		Rajkumar
	29-Aug-23		1		Raj kumar
	30-Aug-23		1		Raj Kumar

select * from Attendance where employeeName='Rajkumar';	//only 1 row is selected
Rajkumar gives a request to change his name.
	now, should we update his name in Employees table and also other tables where name is present.
Also
Because of repeatation, more space occupied in the disk.


1st normal form:	1NF
	A table is said to be in first normal form, if every cell in that table contains precisely only 1 data.

2nd normal form:	2NF
	A table is said to be in second normal form, if it is already in 1NF and every field is functionally dependent on the whole key not partial.

3NF
	all fields are dependent on primary key.




Pending:
Keys
	Primary
	Foreign
	Unique
	Check
	Candidate
	Alternate
	Super
	Composite


RDBMS
	if any product that complies with Dr.E.F.Codd's 12 rules, they are RDBMS

	examples:
		Oracle database
		Microsoft SQL Server
		IBM DB2
		Oracle MySQL
	
Server
	contains database
	admin console

Client
	installed in every client computer
	no db
	all data are accessed from server

	
Oracle 8i
	we do not need to install client in every computer.
	Rather, we use browser to connect with server.

Oracle 9i

Oracle 10g

Oracle 11g

Oracle 12 c

How do we learn SQL and PL/SQL?
	Oracle XE 
	or
	SQL Developer
	or
	SQL Plus

we can use livesql.oracle.com
for now

Activity:
	You already have created an account in livesql.
	Now, login to livesql

	explore the schemas available.
	focus on HR schema - EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS tables

	Use SQL Worksheet to write queries
		SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES;




SQL
	Structured Query Language

What you know about SQL?
	the language used to interact with database.
	most of the rdbms undersand SQL
	each rdbms might have slight difference in their SQL
	ex:	
		t-sql		(MS SQL)
		isql		(Oracle)


Subset of SQL
	DDL
	DML
	DQL
	DCL
	TCL
	

DDL	-	Data Definition Language
DML	-	Data Manipulation Language
DQL	-	Data Query Language
DCL	-	Data Control Language
TCL	- 	Transaction Control Language


DDL
	CREATE
	ALTER
	DROP
	TRUNCATE

DML
	INSERT
	UPDATE
	DELETE
	MERGE
DQL
	SELECT

DCL
	GRANT
	REVOKE

TCL
	COMMIT
	ROLLBACK
	SAVEPOINT



CREATE TABLE jemployees as
select * from hr.employees;

Activity:
	create a copy of 
		HR.EMPLOYEES
		HR.DEPARTMENTS

DDL
	CREATE

While creating the table

CREATE TABLE <<TABLENAME>>
(
	COL1 DATATYPE(SIZE),
	COL2 DATATYPE(SIZE),..........
);



lets create a table:

PRODUCT
	id
	name
	description
	price
	
CREATE TABLE PRODUCT
(
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR2(20),
	description VARCHAR2(20),
	price NUMBER(7,2),
	expiry_date DATE
);


Activity:
	identify the data types of oracle sql.

	try to use the datatypes on a column in the create table statement
