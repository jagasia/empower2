Day 1:
Database Fundamentals - 
Oracle SQL & PL/SQL	Basics, Normalization, SQL(DDL, DML, TCL, DRL, DCL) Commands, Joins
---------------------------------------
Your idea about database:
	to store data in the form of tables
	to manage the data
	to insert/update/delete/merge the data (manipulation)
	to retrieve the data
	to organize the data
	to derive data from the data		(dob to age)
	to prevent redundancies
	to access data from anywhere
	to provide concurrent access

Advantage of database over unstructured data.


data is processed to produce information
Input - Process -Output		(cycle)

1970s	Relational Database concept was invented by Dr. E.F. Codd
row-column format is called as Relation
table is an example for relation
Relations can have relationship

Dr. Codd defines 12 rules for a Relational Database Management System	(RDBMS)

There were several types of databases:
	Logical
	Row based
	E-R		Entity-Relationship
	Hierarchical 	parent-child	(like a tree)
	Object based
	Relational


E-R 
	whenever you design a project, you start identifying the following:
	1) write down the business process in English.
	2) Underline the nouns
	3) Choose the nouns that participate directly in the business

Ex
	customer purchase product

nouns:
	customer
	product

these nouns become ENTITY

these entities become TABLE(s)

the relationship between the entities can be:
	ONE TO ONE
	ONE TO MANY
	MANY TO ONE
	MANY TO MANY

ONE TO ONE
	One Department has One Manager
	in that case, merge them.	
		In department table, add a column called departmentHead

ONE TO MANY
	One Department has Many Employees


DEPARTMENTS
	DID	DNAME	LOCATION	DHEAD	

EMPLOYEES
	EID	ENAME	DID
	101	STEVEN	1
	102	NEENA	1
	103	JAG	1
	104	SUBA	2


MANY TO ONE
	Many Employees belong to One Department
	
MANY TO MANY
	the relationship becomes an entity
	CUSTOMER vs PRODUCT	is many to many
	but the relationship becomes an entity 	SALES

	CUSTOMER
	SALES
	PRODUCT

	So, CUSTOMER to SALES		is One to Many
	PRODUCT to SALES			is One to Many


-------------------
Relational Theory terminology:
Data
Database
Record	/	Row	/	Tuple
Column
NULL
Relation	/	Table	/	Entity
Relationship
UNION
UNION ALL
INTERSECT
JOIN
DIVIDE
MINUS


Data	is the unit of information
Database	is a logical unit of collection of tables and other database objects
	is made up of file(s)
Table	is a logical unit

Record	is a row in the table

NULL	is missing information. It is not a space. It is not 0. It is not (null).
UNION	is combination of the relations.
		10+10	is maximum 20
UNION ALL	10+10	is always 20

INTERSECT	the common records between 2 relations.
MINUS		First relation MINUS the common between Second relation
DIVIDE		To find all the entities which have relationship with all the entities in 		another relation

JOIN		= PRODUCT (Multiplication)
		When we need to retrieve records from more than 1 table, we use JOINs
